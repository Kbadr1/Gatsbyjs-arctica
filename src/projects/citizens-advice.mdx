###### We worked with Citizens Advice to transform the way advice is given to the public <br/> <br/> The Casebook project currently allows 23,000 staff and volunteers across the UK to provide free advice to the public.<br/> <br/> We provided responsive UI development, using React to produce an easy and intuitive UI with a focus on AA WCAG standards compliance. <br/> <br/> In 2018 Casebook won a DigitalAgenda Impact Award, which celebrates tech-for-good innovations that improve people's lives and the world around us.
